# RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Restauraant management system for a catering company. The client can
order products from the company’s menu. The system should have three types of users that log in
using a username and a password: administrator, regular employee, and client.
The administrator can:


- Import the initial set of products which will populate the menu from a .csv file.
- Manage the products from the menu: add/delete/modify products and create new products composed of several products (an example of composed product could be named “daily menu 1” composed of a soup, a steak, a garnish, and a dessert).
- Generate reports about the performed orders considering the following criteria:
    - time interval of the orders – a report should be generated with the orders performed between a given start hour and a given end hour regardless the date.
    - the products ordered more than a specified number of times so far.
    - the clients that have ordered more than a specified number of times and the value of the order was higher than a specified amount.
    - the products ordered within a specified day with the number of times they have been ordered.
The client can:
- Register and use the registered username and password to log in within the system.
- View the list of products from the menu.
- Search for products based on one or multiple criteria such as keyword (e.g. “soup”), rating, number of calories/proteins/fats/sodium/price.
- Create an order consisting of several products – for each order the date and time will be persisted and a bill will be generated that will list the ordered products and the total price of the order.
The employee is notified each time a new order is performed by a client so that it can prepare the
delivery of the ordered products.
